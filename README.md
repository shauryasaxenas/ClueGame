# Star Wars Clue  

A Java-based remake of the classic **Clue (Cluedo)** board game â€” but set in the **Star Wars universe**.  

This project brings the familiar mystery-solving mechanics of Clue into a galaxy far, far away. Players move around the board, make suggestions, and attempt to deduce the correct **suspect**, **weapon**, and **location** to solve the mystery.

## ðŸŽ® Gameplay  

- The game follows the **basic rules of Clue**:
  - Players take turns moving their character across the board.  
  - On your turn, you can enter a location and make a **suggestion** about the suspect, weapon, and room.  
  - Other players can disprove suggestions by showing one of the suggested cards if they have it.  
  - Once youâ€™re confident, you can make an **accusation**.  
  - If youâ€™re correct, you win. If youâ€™re wrong, youâ€™re eliminated from guessing (but still disprove othersâ€™ suggestions).  

- This version replaces the classic Clue elements with **Star Wars characters, weapons, and locations**.
